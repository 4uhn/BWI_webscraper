# BWI Webscraper
This project is a web application that scrapes wine importer data from the Best Wine Importers (BWI) website. It allows users to efficiently extract tabulated data and download it as an Excel file, bypassing the BWI download limit of 500 downloads.

*Note : Login with your actual Best Wine Importer account details*

## Key Functionalities 
* **Country and Origin Selection**: Users can select the country where the importer is located and the origin of the products.

* **Selectable Results** : Users can specify out of the 4 options provided the number of Importers to be extracted.

* **Data Scraped** : Company Name, General Phone Number, Email and Website Link.

* **Excel Output** : The scraped data is provided as a downloadable Excel file.

## Work In Progress
* Currently, the tool does not support more detailed data extraction.   
  
  * Information available by individually clicking into each company, such as LinkedIn profiles.

* The scraper only extracts data visible on the initial results page. It does not automatically navigate through multiple pages of results yet.**
